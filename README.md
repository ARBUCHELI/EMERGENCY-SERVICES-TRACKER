# EMERGENCY-SERVICES-TRACKER

Single page application that features a map of the city (in this case Nizhny Novgorod Russia).  The map will have the functionality of 
finding emergency services in the city (Police Stations and Hospitals).

The app project uses [Google Maps' JavaScript API](http://bit.ly/2DTmniw) with [Foursquare's Search For Venues API](http://bit.ly/2I1X4x9) in 
order to create am application that showcase hospitals and police stations.

A list of all nearby hospitals and police stations is lited in the app.

The initial screen of the app is shown in the picture.

When the user types a place that cannot be found by the APPI, a screen like the picture below is going to be shown.

When the user types in the search box, something like "hospitals", the App is going to list all the hospitals located near to the point with
the coordinates provided to the app.

Finally When the user clicks on one of the objects listed in the screen, the user is going to see the location of the place and other
characteristics like phone numbers.

Note: Some of the features of the app may to be displayed in the screen because Foursquare doesn't have the data on its database.
